# ChinaUnicom Android

Android-native migration of the existing ChinaUnicom iOS application.

## Migration contract

- iOS is the **business behavior baseline**.
- iOS is the **visual baseline** for app-owned UI.
- Android is implemented natively with Kotlin/Jetpack Compose; Swift source is not mechanically translated.
- China Unicom protocol semantics, parsers, cache rules, account grouping, refresh gates and error/session rules must be migrated before feature UI is considered complete.
- Real credentials, cookies, `token_online`, passwords, verification codes and identity data must never be committed.
- Minimum supported Android version: **Android 11 / API 30**.

## Current stage

`Android-M1 — Project Skeleton + Design System` is `PASS / CLOSED`.

`Android-M2 — Core Data Models Migration` is `PASS / CLOSED`.

`Android-M3 — Quota / Remaining Parser Migration + Golden Tests` is `PASS / CLOSED`.

`Android-M4 — HTTP / Cookie / Session Core` is `PASS / CLOSED`.

M4 closure includes source-derived HTTP/Cookie/session behavior, authoritative M2 business models, remaining/unlimited/formatting parity, debug-only Fake Repository isolation, accepted sanitized M4-F real-account evidence, and the final model/parser/network + Debug/Release CI gate.

`Android-M5 — Login + Security Storage` is `IN_PROGRESS`.

M5-A establishes the Android secure credential boundary before login protocols are connected:

- authoritative credential payload remains only Cookie + optional appID + optional token_online;
- account credential blobs are encrypted with AES-256-GCM;
- the AES key is generated and protected by Android Keystore;
- account UUID is authenticated as GCM associated data;
- only encrypted blobs are stored in app-private SharedPreferences;
- plaintext credentials are not written directly to files/preferences;
- multi-account save/read/overwrite/delete/delete-all semantics are covered by regression tests.

`NEXT = Android-M5-B — SMS Login Core`.

M0 is closed for progression by explicit migration decision; the deferred real iOS light/dark screenshot set remains mandatory before M7 visual-parity acceptance.
